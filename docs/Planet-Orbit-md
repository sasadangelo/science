# üåç Simulation: Earth-Sun Elliptical Orbit

This simulation shows a planet (Earth) orbiting around a star (Sun) following an elliptical trajectory caused by gravitational attraction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Physics Principles

The simulation is based on **Newton's Second Law** and **Universal Gravitation**:

- Gravitational force:
  \[
  \vec{F} = -G \cdot \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2} \cdot \hat{r}
  \]

- Acceleration derived from Newton‚Äôs law:
  \[
  \vec{a} = -G \cdot \frac{M}{r^3} \cdot \vec{r}
  \]

Where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (simplified here as 2.0 for visualization purposes)
- \( M \) is the mass of the Sun
- \( m \) is the mass of the Earth
- \( \vec{r} \) is the vector from the Sun to the planet

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Overview

The code is written in **Object-Oriented JavaScript**:

- `Universe`: Holds the gravitational constant and shared properties
- `Sun`: Represents the central star
- `Planet`: Represents the orbiting planet with position and velocity
- `Simulation`: Updates positions and velocities step-by-step
- `Renderer`: Handles drawing on the HTML5 canvas and animating the orbit

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Simulation

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed

2. From the root folder of the project, start a local HTTP server:

   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   ```
3. Open your browser and visit:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/orbit.html
   ```
